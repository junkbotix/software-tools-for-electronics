## Software for Electronics Development

Here you'll find links and other information about software for electronics development. Some of it I have used in the past, some of it I just know about and want to pass on the information. This is not a definitive list, just some things I've found along the way.

<br>

## Calculators

Who doesn't want or use these great tools! Of course, it's best to know how to do these things by hand, but I've honestly forgotten most everything beyond basic Ohm's Law. That happens when you're not "in the industry", so to speak.

## Breadboard/Protoboard/Stripboard Layout Software

This kind of software is mainly meant for non-production stuff - one step up from "winging it" on a breadboard with some parts...

I should use software like this more, but most of the time, graph paper and pencil work fine for the one-off things I do. Even so, I do find myself off in the weeds fixing issues that I maybe could have forseen by using something else.

## Schematic and PCB Capture Software

When you want to have a much nicer board, or you intend to go into some form of production, this software can all be useful.

## Online and others (non-Open Source and/or proprietary)

* https://easyeda.com/ (by JLCPCB - actually a really nice product)
* https://circuitmaker.com/ (by Altium - looks like "free-to-use")
